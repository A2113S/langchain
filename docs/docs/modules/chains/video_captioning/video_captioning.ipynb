    "* verbose (Default: True): Sets verbose mode for downstream chain calls\n",
    "* use_logging (Default: True): Log the chain's processes in run manager\n",
    "* frame_skip (Default: 3): Choose how many video frames to skip during processing. Increasing it results in faster execution, but less accurate results\n",
    "* image_delta_threshold (Default: 3000000): Set the sensitivity for what the image processor considers a change in scenery in the video, used to delimit closed captions. Higher = less sensitive\n",
    "* closed_caption_char_limit (Default: 20): Sets the character limit on closed captions\n",
    "* closed_caption_similarity_threshold (Default: 90): Sets the percentage value to how similar two closed caption models should be in order to be clustered into one longer closed caption\n",
    "* use_unclustered_video_models (Default: False): If true, closed captions that could not be clustered will be included. May result in spontaneous behaviour from closed captions such as very short lasting captions or fast-changing captions. Enabling this is experimental and not recommended"
